LegacyBar an ActionBar for Xamarin.Android (Mono for Android)
===================

This was originally a port of [android-actionbar by Johan Nilson](https://github.com/johannilsson/android-actionbar). 

LegacyBar is under rapid development by Tomasz Cielecki ([@Cheesebaron](http://www.twitter.com/Cheesebaron)) and James Montemagno ([@JamesMontemagno](http://www.twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)) and is quickly moving away from the what the port initially was.

It now features:
* A fully customizeable Action Bar
* 4 Built in base themes
* Integrates with current Menus
* Overflow on API 11+ Devices
* Dynamic Action Bar Item Count based on screen resolution
* Importable library
* Bottom Action Bar (beta)
